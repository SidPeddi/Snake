2. List the names of the team members for your project.

3. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.

    Our project is a one player game based on Snake, the object of the game is to collect all the fish on the board after each fish is collected the avatar
	gets one unit longer. The game ends when no more fish can spawn on the board because the length of the avatar is
	greater than 10. The avatar can be controlled by the player using the arrow keys to move the avatar up, down, left, and right.
	If the player does not touch any of the keys the avatar continues to move in its original direction.
	By using the arrow keys or by allowing the avatar to continue moving forward, the
	player must avoid running into the sides of board or into the obstacle as this results
	in the game ending. As the avatar moves to collect the fish both the playerâ€™s score and its length increase.
